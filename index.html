      <p>War is a classic card game of strategy and... okay, no, not really. It's just 
        pure, dumb luck.
      </p>
      <p>The object is to take as many of the cards in the deck that
         you can. A standard deck of cards is shuffled and dealt out to two or more 
         players. Each player flips the top card of their pile at the same time. Whoever
        has the highest card takes all of the cards played that round. Of course, jacks 
        beat 10s, queens beat jacks, Kings beat queens, and aces beat all!
      </p> 
      <p>
        In the case of a tie, the players leave the flipped cards in the kitty and flip one more each. The winner
        then takes all the cards in the kitty, unless there's a tie! Rinse, repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game is played until all of the cards have been taken. Click the "Play Game" 
        button below. Once this window closed, you can start each round by clicking
        the "Draw" button. Enjoy!
      </p>
      <h2>House Rules</h2>
      <p>
        There's are often variations, or "house rules", when playing a game like this.
        One such variation is where on a tie, three more cards are placed in the kitty, 
        face down, by each player, then one more is flipped over. The winner then takes all the cards.
        Another is the rule where an ace is beaten by a two. Be on the lookout for an update!
